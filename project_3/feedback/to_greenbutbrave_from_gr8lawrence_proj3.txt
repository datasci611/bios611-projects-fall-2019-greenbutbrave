Very ambitious and potentially impactful project. I appreciate your attention to
help the UMD workers with identifying the clients that are most likely to achieve
self-sufficiency. The selected methods (PCA and LASSO regression) are very good methods
for data exploration. And of course, you used Pandas and Tidyverse as your primary
tools of analysis. Since the project is not completed yet, I'll make suggestions based
only on the available parts:

(1) I found the dataset you used in the R file has column names that involve spaces
and parentheses which are a little confusing to the readers and potentially to the compiler. I
suggest using extra steps in Python to rename the columns so they are more programmable
(such as "income_source" instead of "Income Source (Entry)"). I believe the Pandas
dataframe has the method df.columns for this.

(2) It's probably better for you to explain the rationales of Lasso (penalty for avoiding
too many parameters, etc.) and PCA. These are some explainable but not so intuitive methods.
Also, I personally think Lasso alone can do a great job in reducing parameter dimensionality.
Therefore, using only Lasso on the given covariates might produce something more interpretable.
PCA is great too but a little harder to interpret when you use it and use Lasso to select
principal components.

### Background: What is "The Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) Project"?
The Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) Project aims for connecting with the community to diminish homelessness and fighting poverty through providing food, shelter and a future to neighbors with special needs (UMD, 2019).
### Data Cited
Provided by the Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) Project Team (http://www.umdurham.org/)
### Variables
1. Client File Number (Identifier)
2. Bus Tickets: Service discontinued
3. Food: # of people in the family for which food was provided
4. Food Pounds: # of pounds of food that each individual or family received when shopping the food pantry
5. Clothing Items: # of clothing items that each individual or family received in the clothing closet
6. Diapers: # of packs of diapers received (individuals/families are given 2 packs of diapers per child, and packs contain 22 diapers on average)
7. School Kits
8. Hygiene Kits: # of kits received per individual or family. Kits contain soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, deodorant, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a washcloth, a disposable razor, and a bottle of shaving cream.
9. Financial Support: Service discontinued

```
### Analyses
#### Data Cleaning
1. Import the data
```{r warning=FALSE}
rawdata <- read.table(file = 'UMD_Services_Provided_20190719.txt', sep = '\t', fill = TRUE, header = TRUE)
```
2. Rename the variables
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- rawdata %>%
rename(ClientID = Client.File.Number, Bus = Bus.Tickets..Number.of., Note = Notes.of.Service,
Food = Food.Provided.for, Clothing = Clothing.Items) %>%
select(Date, ClientID, Bus, Food, Food.Pounds, Clothing, Diapers, School.Kits, Hygiene.Kits,
Referrals, Note, Financial.Support)
head(data)
```
3. Filtering
Given that the UMD was estabblished in 1983, we should remove some rows with dates before 1983 or after 2019. Here, the Date data was converted into DATE format.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
data = data %>%
filter(Date >= "1983-01-01" & Date <= "2019-10-01")
```
4. Trimming: detect, visualize and test for outliers
First, I have a look at columns of the UMD dataset with boxplot.
```{r warning=FALSE}
boxplot(data$Bus, data$Food, data$Food.Pounds, data$Cloth, data$Diapers, data$School.Kits,
data$Hygiene.Kits, data$Financial.Support,
main = "Multiple boxplots of the UMD Raw Data",
xlab = "Service Provided", ylab = "Value",
names = c("Bus", "Food", "Food.lb", "Cloth", "Diapers", "Sch.Kits", "Hyg.Kits",
"Fin.Sup"),
col = "cyan", border = "Blue", outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5)
```
- Bus
According to the box-plot and rosnertest, I got 4 outliers greater than or equal to 7.
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(data$Bus)
boxplot(data$Bus, outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5, xlab = "Bus", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
rosnerTest(data$Bus, k = 10, warn = F)
```
The outliers were excluded.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- data[-which(data$Bus >= 7),]
boxplot(data$Bus, main = "Bus: After removing the outliers", xlab = "Bus", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
- Food
According to the box-plot and rosnertest, I got 9 outliers greater than or equal to 11.
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(data$Food)
boxplot(data$Food, outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5, xlab = "Food", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
rosnerTest(data$Food, k = 10, warn = F)
```
The outliers were excluded.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- data[-which(data$Food >= 11),]
boxplot(data$Food, main = "Food: After removing the outliers", xlab = "Food", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
- Food.Pounds
According to the box-plot and rosnertest, I got 1 outlier greater than or equal to 200.
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(data$Food.Pounds)
boxplot(data$Food.Pounds, outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5, xlab = "Food.Pounds", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
rosnerTest(data$Food.Pounds, k = 5, warn = F)
```
The outliers were excluded.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- data[-which(data$Food.Pounds >= 200),]
boxplot(data$Food.Pounds, main = "Food.Pounds: After removing the outliers", xlab = "Food.Pounds", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
- Clothing
According to the box-plot and rosnertest, I got outliers greater than or equal to 36.
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(data$Clothing)
boxplot(data$Clothing, outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5, xlab = "Clothing", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
rosnerTest(data$Clothing, k = 100, warn = F)
```
The outliers were excluded.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- data[-which(data$Clothing >= 36),]
boxplot(data$Clothing, main = "Clothing: After removing the outliers", xlab = "Clothing", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
- Diapers
According to the box-plot and rosnertest, I got outliers greater than or equal to 36.
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(data$Diapers)
boxplot(data$Diapers, outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5, xlab = "Diapers", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
rosnerTest(data$Diapers, k = 5, warn = F)
```
The outliers were excluded.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- data[-which(data$Diapers >= 36),]
boxplot(data$Diapers, main = "Diapers: After removing the outliers", xlab = "Diapers", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
- Hygiene.Kits
According to the box-plot and rosnertest, I got outliers greater than or equal to 3.
```{r warning=FALSE}
boxplot(data$Hygiene.Kits, outcol = "red", outcex = 1.5, xlab = "Hygiene.Kits", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
summary(data$Hygiene.Kits)
rosnerTest(data$Hygiene.Kits, k = 10, warn = F)
```
The outliers were excluded.
```{r warning=FALSE}
data <- data[-which(data$Hygiene.Kits >= 3),]
boxplot(data$Hygiene.Kits, main = "Hygiene.Kits: After removing the outliers", xlab = "Hygiene.Kits", ylab = "Value", col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
- Multiple boxplots
```{r warning=FALSE}
boxplot(data$Bus, data$Food, data$Food.Pounds, data$Cloth, data$Diapers, data$School.Kits,
data$Hygiene.Kits, main = "Multiple boxplots: After removing the
outliers", xlab = "Service Provided", ylab = "Value",
names = c("Bus", "Food", "Food.lb", "Cloth", "Diapers", "Sch.Kits", "Hyg.Kits"),
col = "cyan", border = "Blue")
```
#### The Number of (New) Clients Served by UMD
